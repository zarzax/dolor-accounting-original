==NOTE==
This is a console based app.  there is no web interface to this remediation.

==Documention Note==
We have ran Doxygen on our code to generate some additional documentation.  It has a nice listing
how our classes interact with eachother.  It is available in doc/html/index.html

==how to MAKE===
Test everything.
	make
	note: creates all the binarys in the bin dir and creates the binary 'dolor' in the main dir.  
	runs make.cpp as main interface file.


Classes (a bit out of date on public and private vars):
check the inc directory /src/inc:

Transaction - 	contains the info relating to a single transaction and how to print it to the screen.
				functions: show(), setTransaction()
				public vars: int amount, month, day, year, idnum; string memo, tofrom; bool isExpense;
				
Accounts - 		works with multiple transactions to form an account.  
				functions: 	create(), shortShow(), longShow(), instertTransaction(), removeTransaction(), 
							read(), write(), updateBalance(), empty(), emptyAccount()
				public vars: string name, memo; int accountNumber, balance;
				
Books (from: set_of_books.h) - 	takes multiple accounts and stores them in xml listing.
											

	
ADDITIONAL LIBRARIES USED:
check the lib directory  /src/inc/lib

===Strextra===
We created this library to convert c_str() to strings and the reverse.  using templates.
